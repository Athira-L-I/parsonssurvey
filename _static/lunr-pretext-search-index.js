  "body": " Student Quick Guide    What are Parsons Problems?  Parsons Problems give you mixed-up lines of code. Your job is to drag them into the correct order and set proper indentation to make a working program.    How to Solve  1. Read the Problem  Understand what the function should do. Look at the example inputs and outputs.  2. Drag Lines to the Right  Move code lines from the left side to the right side in the order you think is correct.  3. Set Indentation  Some lines need to be indented. Use arrows to indent or unindent lines. Getting indentation right is important in Python!  4. Check Your Solution  Click Check button to see if your solution is correct. Lines that are incorrect will be highlighted in red. Lines that are correct will be highlighted in green.  5. Try Again if Wrong  Look at which lines are red, think about what needs to change, and try again. Keep trying until all lines are green!    Important Rules  Work Independently  No help from friends, internet, or books. Do your best on your own.  Complete All Four Problems  Try your best on each problem. If you cannot solve it, do your best and move on.  Take Your Time  Think carefully. The total session should take about 40-50 minutes.  Do Problems in Order  Start with Problem 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. Do not skip ahead.  Need Help?  Raise your hand if you have questions about the interface or if something isn't working. The coordinator can help with technical issues but cannot help solve the problems.  Good Luck!   "

  "title": "Introduction to Parsons Problems",
  "body": " Introduction to Parsons Problems   Welcome to the Parsons Problems practice session! In this section, you will get familiar with how Parsons Problems work before attempting the actual test problems.  A Parsons Problem presents you with all the lines of code needed to solve a programming task, but they are mixed up. Your job is to:    Drag the code blocks from the left side to the right side  Arrange them in the correct order  Set the proper indentation for each line    Let's start with a simple practice problem to get you comfortable with the interface.    Practice Problem 1: Simple Function  This is a simple warm-up problem. Try to arrange the code blocks in the correct order to create a function that prints a greeting message.    Arrange the following code blocks to create a function called greet that takes a name as a parameter and prints \"Hello, [name]!\"     def greet(name):    message = \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"    print(message)      Tips for solving Parsons Problems:     Read the problem description carefully  Think about the logical flow of the program  Pay attention to indentation - it matters in Python!  Use the Check button to test your solution  Don't worry if you make mistakes - you can try again      Practice Problem 2: Conditional Statement  Now let's try a slightly more complex problem that involves a conditional statement.    Arrange the code blocks to create a function called check_positive that takes a number as a parameter and returns True if the number is positive, and False otherwise.     def check_positive(num):    if num > 0:    return True    else:    return False        Practice Problem 3: With Paired Distractors  This problem includes paired distractors . For some steps, you will be presented with a choice between a correct code block and an incorrect one. Your job is to identify and use only the correct block from each pair. This is what you'll see in the test problems.    Arrange the code blocks to create a function called is_even that takes a number and returns True if it's even, False if it's odd.     def is_even(num):     if num % 2 == 0:    if num % 2 = 0:     return True    else:     return False    return true       Notice: You had to choose the correct line from pairs of correct and incorrect code. In the test, you'll also need to identify which lines are correct and which are distractors.    Are You Ready?  Great work on the practice problems! You should now be familiar with:    How to drag and drop code blocks  How to arrange blocks in the correct order  How to set proper indentation  How to check your solution and interpret feedback      Do you feel ready to proceed to the actual Parsons Problems test?     Yes, I'm ready to start the test    I need more practice (you can review the problems above)      When you're ready, click the Next button to begin the test section.   Remember: In the test section, you will have three problems to solve. Take your time, read each problem carefully, and do your best!   "
