    <title>What are Parsons Problems?</title>
    <p>
      Parsons Problems give you mixed-up lines of code. Your job is to drag
      them into the correct order and set proper indentation to make a working
      program.

    <title>How to Solve</title>
    
    <p><term>1. Read the Problem</term></p>
    <p>
      Understand what the function should do. Look at the example inputs and
      outputs.
    </p>

    <p><term>2. Drag Lines to the Right</term></p>
    <p>
      Move code lines from the left side to the right side in the order you
      think is correct.
    </p>

    <p><term>3. Set Indentation</term></p>
    <p>
      Some lines need to be indented. Use arrows to indent or unindent lines. Getting indentation right is important in Python!
    </p>

    <p><term>4. Check Your Solution</term></p>
    <p>
      Click Check button to see if your solution is correct. Lines that are 
      incorrect will be highlighted in red. Lines that are correct will be 
      highlighted in green.
    </p>

    <p><term>5. Try Again if Wrong</term></p>
    <p>
      Look at which lines are red, think about what needs to change, and try 
      again. Keep trying until all lines are green!

    <title>Important Rules</title>

    <p><term>Work Independently</term></p>
    <p>
      No help from friends, internet, or books. Do your best on your own.
    </p>

    <p><term>Complete All Four Problems</term></p>
    <p>
      Try your best on each problem. If you cannot solve it, do your best and move on.
    </p>

    <p><term>Take Your Time</term></p>
    <p>
      Think carefully. The total session should take about 
      40-50 minutes.
    </p>

    <p><term>Do Problems in Order</term></p>
    <p>
      Start with Problem 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. Do not skip ahead.
    </p>

    <p><term>Need Help?</term></p>
    <p>
      Raise your hand if you have questions about the interface or if something 
      isn't working. The
      coordinator can help with technical issues but cannot help solve the
      problems.
